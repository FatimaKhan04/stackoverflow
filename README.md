# StackOverflow
This Python script utilizes Selenium to scrape user data from Stack Overflow. It searches for users based on a specified query ("react"), extracts information such as username, location, reputation score, user tags,
and profile picture URL, and saves the data in a CSV file named user_data.csv.
The script automatically handles pagination to gather data from multiple pages.
# Note
The script's features are tailored for scraping user data specifically from Stack Overflow.
Users should review and adhere to Stack Overflow's terms of service when using the script.
